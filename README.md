### Context
- Oftentimes we do not have access to a wealth of labeled data or computing power to build image classification deep learning models from scratch.
- Fortunately, transfer learning empowers us to develop robust image classifiers for our specific classification tasks, even if we have limited resources.
- In this easy-to-follow step-by-step guide, we will learn how to utilize pre-trained models as part of transfer learning in TensorFlow to classify images effectively and efficiently.

### Files
- Tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks are found in the `notebooks` folder
  - Oxford-IIIT pets dataset
  - Stanford cars dataset

### Feedback
- Any question or suggestions to improve the explanations? I look forward to hearing from you!
