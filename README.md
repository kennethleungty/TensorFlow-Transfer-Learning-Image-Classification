#  TensorFlow Tutorial - Transfer Learning for Multi-Class Car Image Classification
### Step-by-step tutorial to using pre-trained ResNet50 model for multi-class image classification of Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset

### Context
- Oftentimes we do not have access to a wealth of labeled data or computing power to build image classification deep learning models from scratch.
- Fortunately, transfer learning empowers us to develop robust image classifiers for our specific classification tasks, even if we have limited resources.
- In this easy-to-follow step-by-step guide, we will learn how to utilize pre-trained models as part of transfer learning in TensorFlow to classify images effectively and efficiently.

### Files
- The tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks are found in the `notebooks` folder
